## Overview

**PlanYT** is a Chrome extension that helps you complete YouTube playlists by converting them into **clear daily schedules** with **multiple plan management** and **progress tracking**.

Instead of overwhelming total durations, you get a structured plan you can actually follow.

---

## Why PlanYT?

Most playlists are abandoned because they are:

- Too long
- Poorly planned
- Hard to track

**PlanYT solves this** by breaking playlists into manageable daily goals and tracking your progress automatically.
